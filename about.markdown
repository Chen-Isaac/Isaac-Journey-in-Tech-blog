Hello! I'm Isaac, a passionate engineer with a keen interest in motor control and programming. 

I started this blog as a platform to share my journey in the tech world, with a particular focus on motor control and programming. I believe in the power of sharing knowledge and experiences, and I hope that the content you find here will help you in your own journey.

In my day job, I work as an engineer in a tech company, where I get to apply my skills and knowledge to solve real-world problems. I love the challenge and the constant learning that comes with it.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, hiking, and spending time with my family. I'm also a big fan of coffee and always up for a good conversation.

If you have any questions or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out to me through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/isaac-xinxi-chen/) or [GitHub](https://github.com/Chen-Isaac).

Thank you for visiting my blog!
